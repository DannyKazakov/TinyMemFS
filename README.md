## About The Project

During my studies in Software and Information Systems Engineering, we learned application developemnt using C# with WPF and Windows Form.
We've Learned many aspects of Object Oriented Programming including Multithreaded programming.
This project mimics A memory File System, where files are saved, created and handled in RAM.
There are options to load different files, encrypt or decryps (using AES encryption), compress them and afterwards saving the whole file system on disk.

### Built With
C# Windows Form Applications
Multithread Programming
## Workflow

After running the application you will be presented with the startup screen where you choose how to create your table:
![TinyFSGIF](https://github.com/DannyKazakov/TinyMemFS/assets/113122323/f6a30dbb-5eb6-49ea-82ad-1064a7c6fa8d)

There are many options to choose from: Encrypt, Decrypt, Compress, Uncompress, Remove, Add, Save, Set as hidden, Rename, Copy, Compare.
Inorder to start working on the File System first you should add file via their path and what name you want them to have.

### Features
* Add - Adding a file to the TinyFS via path and naming it.
* Save - Save the file to the disk
* Set as Hidden - Set file as hidden to the user
* Rename - Rename the file
* Copy - Copy the contents of one existing file to another existing file in the TinyFS
* Remove - Remove file from the TinyFS
* Compare - Size and content of two files in the TinyFS
* Encrypt - Encrypt via AES all files in TinyFS. add a key of your choosing
* Decrypt - Decrypt via AES all Files in TinyFS. Needs to be with the same encryption key.
* Compress and Uncompress - A file in the TinyFS system.

You have the ability of saving the fileSystem and load an existing one.
